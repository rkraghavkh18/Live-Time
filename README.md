Amid the lockdown/Work-from-Home, Indians have turned to social media to pass their time. In the first week of lockdown, Indians spent more than four hours every day on social media. This is a 87 per cent increase from a week before lockdown and continuously increasing this could be leading to increased stress levels in nearly half of them and impacting their health and physical life, a study has found.It becomes more difficult for them to interact with others.‚Äù Social media allows us to view others as less than people, as profiles. When you spend excessive amounts of time on social media you can begin to numb yourself to the feelings and emotions of those physically interacting with you.
